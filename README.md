# Overview of Analysis
The purpose of this module and assessment was to learn and implement visualizations using Tableau. This software is very fun, easy, and intuitive to use. It only takes a couple of hours to realize how many possibilities there truly are when using this platform. We were tasked with creating visualizations for a presentation to give a board of investors our case towards opening a new branch of a bike company in another city. We were able to use data that was neatly stored in a CSV file to create wonderful visualizations.

## Results

Below I will summarize the findings of each visualization in 1-2 sentences. The following link will show the visualizations mentioned in the summaries below.

### Checkout Times for Users
This graph showcases that most bikes rides are around 6 minutes long in New York City. Since the city is so dense, it is not overly surprising, but one may initially think without data that the average time would be much longer. 

### Checkout Times by Gender
This graph illustrates that it is mostly males that checkout the bikes that Citibike has to offer. This can be useful marketing information as it seems that there are almost three times less female riders than male riders.

### Trips by Weekday for Each Hour
This heatmap shows what days and times of the week where there are the most bike riders. At first glance, the weekend days are much more popular than that of the weekdays. Although, Thursdays are very popular. 8AM is the most popular time during the week while 12 pm is the most popular time during the weekend. 

### Trips by Gender
This map shows that the male users of the bikes have a favorite day and time of day in which they ride. That is Thursday at 8AM. The rest of the information on this graph doesn't provide much as it's just a sea of colors. 

### Trips by Weekday
Trips by Weekday shows that male subscribers are the dominant figure to note. Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays are very popular amongst Citibikes male Subcribers.


## Summary
In Summary, it is hard to draw conclusions from only visualizations. However, some of these visualizations are telling. I would imagine that if the top decision-makers are looking to launch in a city that is much smaller than NY, I would think it would be wisest to primarily market to males in that new city to test the waters. A lot of the telling information showed that men were the dominant player in the use of this product.
